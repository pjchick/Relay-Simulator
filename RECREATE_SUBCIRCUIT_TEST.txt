Instructions to Recreate SubTest1 Circuit
==========================================

Your SubTest1.rsim file has corrupted wire tab IDs from the ID regeneration bug.
Now that the bug is fixed, create a fresh test circuit:

STEPS:
------
1. Launch the application:
   > python relay_simulator\app.py

2. Create a new circuit (File > New or Ctrl+N)

3. Place components on the page:
   - SubCircuit (from toolbox) - place at center
   - Switch (left side)
   - Indicator (right side)

4. Connect them:
   - Wire from Switch → SubCircuit SUB_IN pin
   - Wire from SubCircuit SUB_OUT pin → Indicator

5. Save the file as SubTest1_fixed.rsim

6. Test the simulation:
   - Click the simulation play button
   - Click the switch - the indicator should light up
   - Click the switch again - the indicator should stay lit (latching behavior)

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
------------------
- Switch ON → SubCircuit receives signal on SUB_IN
- SubCircuit internal relay energizes and latches
- SUB_OUT goes HIGH, lighting the indicator
- Switch OFF → Indicator stays lit (latch holds)

TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------
If it still doesn't work, check:
- Are wires properly connected (green dots at connection points)?
- Is simulation running (play button pressed)?
- Check the internal pages of the SubCircuit to verify components are there

FILE VALIDATION:
----------------
After saving, you can verify the file has correct tab IDs by searching for any of these patterns:
- Tab IDs should look like: "component_id.pin_name.tab_name"
- CORRECT: "e83b0191.pin1.tab1"
- WRONG: "e83b0191.ea5cfb12.3b9845c7"

If you see the wrong pattern, the bug may not be fully fixed.
